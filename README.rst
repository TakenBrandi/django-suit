===========
Django Suit
===========

* Clone of djarklow's django-suit package that replaces the default django admin.
 * `Original README.rst <./ORIGINAL-README.rst>`_
 * Original repo on `github <https://github.com/darklow/django-suit>`_
* Team-Zeus repo on `github <https://github.com/Team-Zeus/django-suit>`_

This repo only exists because it took me quite a while to find Team-Zeus's repo, and
I haven't found a repo that says it's django 3.0 compatible in its readme, so now there
is one. I recommend following Team-Zeus unless and until I need to make changes for
django 4 compatibility. At the time of writing, this is a clone of Team-Zeus's
master branch.
